## Introduction {#sec-intro}

<!-- What about https://bookdown.org/jgscott/DSGI/the-bootstrap.html#bootstrapping-summaries as an example dataset? Sleep data from NHANES 2011-12.  -->

<!-- Define bootstrap, and varieties, and examples of use, with tables of numbers.  -->
<!-- - Lay out the situations where resampling/bootstrap are useful. -->
<!-- - Primarily, used to get a sense of the behavior/distribution of a statistic -->

We frequently come across data which does not come with an attached standard distribution (or any theoretical reasons we might assume such a distribution).
In these cases, we still may want to understand the uncertainty in our estimates, but we do not have distributional theory to rely on; instead, we may use resampling to assess the variability of estimates via the **bootstrap**. 
The bootstrap works via the assumption that the main source of variability in the estimate is the sampling process; by resampling the data, we can mimic the variability of the process and better understand the variability of the quantities we have estimated.




Introduce lineup/Rorschach protocols. Graphics are statistics, but ultimately, resampling/bootstrap methods are of limited use in graphics because of two primary issues: 
- overplotting, which limits the utility of resampling because of lack of visual novelty, and 
- limited ability to evaluate the test statistics - we can computationally evaluate thousands of samples in fractions of a second, but viewing thousands of plots is much more time consuming.

Why? Motivational example: Classic bootstrap example, and show what happens with plots - points disappear.

Structure of this paper?

## Bootstrap effect on plots

Outline of commonly used bootstrap/resampling approaches and evaluation of graphical challenges. Need to show this with lineups.

- bootstrap problem:
    - scatterplot
    - histogram should be ok, but could have unusually high bars
    - density plots also should be ok, but might have bibbles og high-density
- parametric bootstrap
- residual resampling (https://bookdown.org/jgscott/DSGI/the-bootstrap.html#bootstrapping-summaries footnote)
- permutation
- high-dimensions?

Solutions

- jitter - persistent




```{r}
if (!"nhanesA" %in% installed.packages()) devtools::install_github("cjendres1/nhanes")
library(nhanesA)
nhanesSearchVarName("SleepHrsNight")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
library(ggbeeswarm)
set.seed(1152)
NHANES_sleep <- read_csv("data/NHANES_sleep.csv")
n <- nrow(NHANES_sleep)
bin <- 1
nh_sample <- sample_frac(NHANES_sleep, 0.1)
d <- nh_sample %>% 
  select(SleepHrsNight) %>%
  rename(b0 = SleepHrsNight) %>%
  mutate(b1 = sample(b0, replace=TRUE),
         b2 = sample(b0, replace=TRUE),
         b3 = sample(b0, replace=TRUE)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=everything(), names_to="sample", values_to="b")
ggplot(d) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = b), binwidth=bin) +
  facet_wrap(~sample, ncol=2)
ggplot(d) + 
  geom_quasirandom(aes(x = sample, y=b), alpha=0.1) 
ggplot(d) + 
  geom_violin(aes(x = sample, y=b)) 
ggplot(d) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = sample, y=b)) 
```

There is a sample size effect: large samples probably not many issues. Smaller samples, eg 10% of the NHANES (~800 observations) there is 
- piling in the histogram
- pitted patterns in jittered dotplot
- extremes missing in violin plots and boxplots
