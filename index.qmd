## Introduction {#sec-intro}

Lay out the situations where resampling/bootstrap are useful 

Primarily, used to get a sense of the behavior/distribution of a statistic

Graphics are statistics, but ultimately, resampling/bootstrap methods are of limited use in graphics because of two primary issues: overplotting, which limits the utility of resampling because of lack of visual novelty, and limited ability to evaluate the test statistics - we can computationally evaluate thousands of samples in fractions of a second, but viewing thousands of plots is much more time consuming.
