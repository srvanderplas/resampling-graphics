  abstract = {Abstract                            This article provides an introduction to the bootstrap. The bootstrap provides statistical inferences{\textemdash}standard error and bias estimates, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests{\textemdash}without assumptions such as Normal distributions or equal variances. As such, bootstrap methods can be remarkably more accurate than classical inferences based on Normal or               t               distributions. The bootstrap uses the same basic procedure regardless of the statistic being calculated, without requiring the use of application-specific formulae. This article may provide two big surprises for many readers. The first is that the bootstrap shows that common               t               confidence intervals are woefully inaccurate when populations are skewed, with one-sided coverage levels off by factors of two or more, even for very large samples. The second is that the number of bootstrap samples required is much larger than generally realized.

  abstract = {Statistical inference provides the protocols for conducting rigorous science, but data plots provide the opportunity to discover the unexpected. These disparate endeavors are bridged by visual inference, where a lineup protocol can be employed for statistical testing. Human observers are needed to assess the lineups, typically using a crowd-sourcing service. This paper describes a new approach for computing statistical significance associated with the results from applying a lineup protocol. It utilizes a Dirichlet distribution to accommodate different levels of visual interest in individual null panels. The suggested procedures facilitate statistical inference for a broader range of data problems.},

  abstract = {It has been approximately 100 years since the very first formal experimental evaluations of statistical charts were conducted. In that time, technological changes have impacted both our charts and our testing methods, resulting in a dizzying array of charts, many different taxonomies to classify graphics, and several different philosophical approaches to testing the efficacy of charts and graphs experimentally. Once rare, charts and graphical displays are now everywhere{\textemdash}but do they help us understand? In this article we review the history of graphical testing across disciplines, discuss different direct approaches to testing graphics, and contrast direct tests with visual inference, which requires that the viewer determine both the question and the answer. Examining the past 100 years of graphical testing, we summarize best practices for creating effective graphics and discuss what the future holds for graphics and empirical testing of interactive statistical visualizations.},
